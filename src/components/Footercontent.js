               <h1>What is web hosting?</h1>
               <p>Your website is hosted when a hosting company allocates room on its web server for a website's files(codes, content, etc) to be stored. The files that make up a website are made available for viewing online through web hosting. Every website that you visit on the internet is hosted on the server so you can access it online. In short, web hosting is buying or renting a space which can be either cloud or dedicated server in order to store websites on the internet. Scripts, codes, images and other content of the website are stored in the hosting server, so it can be accessed online by visitors. </p>
               <p>So, what exactly is a server? A server is a computer that hosting providers store websites in. Servers have certain storage and speed capacity to house websites. It connects online users from all around the world to your website. In other words, web hosting servers make your website viewable all the time in the world wide web. Web hosting service providers, as the name implies, are companies that provide the servers, connection, and related services needed to host websites. They span the spectrum of hosting needs, from small blogs to huge companies, by offering a choice of hosting plans. </p>
               <p>If you want to build an online presence, you'll need reliable web hosting. Today, there are literally hundreds of web hosts offering thousands of different web hosting services. Plans range from free with few features to pricey business-focused web hosting services. The plan you select will be based on how you intend to use your website and how much money you have set up for hosting.</p>
               <h2>Why do you need web hosting?</h2>
               <p>A web hosting provider is required for your website which is either business or hobby to be published online. You have to store your website content including development code in the hosting server in order to make it up and running online. A web host, on the other hand, provides more than just web hosting services to business owners! Web hosting companies generally employ in-house experts to ensure that their clients' websites are up and running 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
               <h2>Different types of web hosting</h2>
               <p>The quantity of space allotted to a website on a server is determined by the type of hosting. Shared, dedicated, VPS, and reseller hosting are the most common types of hosting. They are distinguished by the type of server technology used, the level of management provided, and the additional services available. </p>
               <h2>Shared web hosting</h2>
               <p>Shared hosting is a type of web hosting in which a single server is used to host many websites. For example, Site A, Site B, Site C, Site D, and Site E all share the same server. The benefit is that because the server costs are shared by several sites, shared web hosting is often relatively affordable. It's a low-cost web hosting service. Indeed, you may obtain a plan for less than $10 per month. You may consider the sites that share your server to be your housemates; there isn't much that separates you from them. Even if you close the bedroom door, they might still give you nightmares in the kitchen and bathroom. Because all of the sites share a single server's resources, large traffic spikes on Site A may have an influence on the performance of the other sites. If the shared server crashes hard enough, another site may be able to take it down completely. </p>
               <h2>VPS web hosting</h2>
               <p>VPS hosting is similar to shared hosting in that it allows numerous websites to use a single server, but that's where the similarities end. VPS hosting is similar to renting your own apartment in a larger complex in terms of housing. You're much more secluded than in the last roommate situation; it's still possible that a nearby apartment would disturb you, but it's far less likely. In terms of web hosting, Site A's traffic surge will have a far smaller influence on Site B and Site C. VPS hosting is more expensive than shared hosting, as you might imagine. You'll pay somewhere between $20 and $60 every month.</p>
               <h2>Dedicated web hosting</h2>
               <p>On the other hand, dedicated hosting is both powerful and expensive. It's only for sites that necessitate a massive amount of server resources. A dedicated hosting service, dedicated server, or managed hosting service is a type of Internet hosting in which the client leases an entire server not shared with anyone else. Many web hosting companies also offer managed hosting in addition to dedicated hosting. In this case, the web host serves as your IT department, taking care of server maintenance and upkeep.</p>
               <h2>Reseller web hosting</h2>
               <p>Reseller hosting is a type of web hosting in which the account holder can use his or her allotted hard drive space and bandwidth to host websites for others. In this case, the â€˜reseller' is the owner of the original hosting account. When the quantity of space purchased isn't needed and some of the allocated resources can be shared with another party, reseller hosting is a good option. While earning a recurring stream of money, you can share disk space, bandwidth, CPU, and other resources.</p>
               <h2>WordPress web hosting</h2>
               <p>WordPress hosting is for users who want to use WordPress.org's popular content management system (CMS) to develop their websites. This free, open-source blogging and site-building platform can be used in a variety of ways. </p>
               <h2>How can you choose the best web hosting provider?</h2>
               <p>Many web providers provide limited functionality in their entry-level plans before expanding the capabilities in their higher-tier plans. If you need a site builder to develop your website, be sure the low-cost web host you choose includes one. Many of them demand that you pay for the website builder separately. Website builders usually don't cost a lot of money, but if you can find a web host that includes one for free, that's money in your pocket. And, if it's integrated with your hosting service, you're more likely to have a smooth, supported experience. </p>
               <p>You should also look for a web host that offers customer service 24/7, if not by phone, then at least by chat. Forums, knowledge bases, and support tickets are all well and good, but sometimes you just need to talk to another person to get things straightened out.</p>
               <p>You must have email if you want to have a web presence. It's a quick and easy way for potential clients and consumers to send you a message, a Word document, or other items. Fortunately, most site hosting services include email as part of their hosting packages. Some web hosting providers allow you to create an unlimited number of email accounts, while others limit you to a certain number. You should, of course, desire unlimited email</p>
               <p>The aforementioned qualities are useful for web hosting, but none of them compare to the importance of site uptime. Clients and consumers will be unable to find you or access your products or services if your website is down. You have to run away from web hosting providers with uptime issues.</p>
               <p>Here are the top features to consider when you choose web hosting for your website:</p>
               <ul className='footer-lists'>
                   <li>Uptime, uptime and uptime!</li>
                   <li>Site speed</li>
                   <li>Customer support</li>

                   <li>Migration features</li>
               </ul>
               <p>These are the major factors that you should consider when choosing a web hosting provider. Whatever you intend to do with your website, you can achieve it with the best providers of these features.</p>
